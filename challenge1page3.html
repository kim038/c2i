    <h1>Capilano Suspension Bridge</h1>
    <p>The Capilano Suspension Bridge is named after its iconic bridge, which measures 140 meters long and hangs 70
        meters above the Capilano River. Beyond the bridge, a rainforest-like canopy awaits with further trails and
        platforms among the trees.</p>
    <p>Among <a href="challenge1page2.html">Whistler</a> and <a href="challenge1page4.html">Grouse Mountain</a>, the
        Capilano Suspension Bridge has
        cemented itself as a
        keystone of Canada's West Coast.</p>
