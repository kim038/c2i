    <h1>Whistler</h1>
    <p>Whistler is the biggest ski resort in North America, and is home to the Blackcomb Mountains, one of Canada's most
        prized natural beauties. Named after the Whistling Marmot, Whistler is incredibly well known for its trails and
        hikes.</p>
    <p>Among the <a href="challenge1page3.html">Capilano Suspension Bridge</a> and <a href="challenge1page4.html">Grouse
            Mountain</a>, Whistler has
        cemented itself as a
        keystone of Canada's West Coast.</p>
